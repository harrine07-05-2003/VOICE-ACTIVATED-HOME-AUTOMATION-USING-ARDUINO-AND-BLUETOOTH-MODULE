# VOICE-ACTIVATED-HOME-AUTOMATION-USING-ARDUINO-AND-BLUETOOTH-MODULE
Voice-activated home automation using Arduino and a Bluetooth module allows you to control various devices in your home using voice commands. The system consists of an Arduino board, a Bluetooth module, relay modules, and the electrical devices you want to control.
The Arduino board serves as the central controller for the system. It receives voice commands via Bluetooth from a connected device, such as a smartphone or computer. The Bluetooth module acts as the communication bridge between the Arduino and the connected device, facilitating wireless data transmission.
The voice recognition and command parsing logic is implemented in the Arduino code. The Arduino code is written using the Arduino IDE and uploaded to the Arduino board. The code utilizes the SoftwareSerial library to communicate with the Bluetooth module and parse the received voice commands.
When a voice command is received via Bluetooth, the Arduino code processes the command and triggers the corresponding relay based on the recognized command. For example, if the command is "turn on the light," the code activates the relay connected to the light, thereby turning it on. Similarly, if the command is "turn off the fan," the code activates the relay connected to the fan, turning it off.
